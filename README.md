# Django Music Player

Based on TechWithTim's WebApp 'House Party' tutorial

The idea of this project is that a 'host' of a room can conect to their spotify account and play music. Others can join the room and also control the music or decide skip the song, and host can determine how many votes are needed to skip

To use, you must get API credentials from Spotify and add to credentials.py. Also need to add redirect link in spotify settings
